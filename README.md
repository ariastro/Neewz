## Tech stack & Open-source libraries
- Minimum SDK level 26
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) based, [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) + [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/) for asynchronous.
- Jetpack
  - [Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose): Modern toolkit for building native UI
  - Lifecycle: Observe Android lifecycles and handle UI states upon the lifecycle changes.
  - ViewModel: Manages UI-related data holder and lifecycle aware. Allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
  - Room: Constructs Database by providing an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access.
  - [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/): for dependency injection.
- Architecture
  - Clean Architecture
  - MVVM Architecture (Model - View - ViewModel)
  - Repository Pattern
- [Compose Destination](https://github.com/raamcosta/compose-destinations): A KSP library that processes annotations and generates code that uses Official Jetpack Compose Navigation under the hood.
- [Retrofit2 & OkHttp3](https://github.com/square/retrofit): Construct the REST APIs and paging network data.
- [Sandwich](https://github.com/skydoves/Sandwich): Construct a lightweight and modern response interface to handle network payload for Android.
- [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi/): A modern JSON library for Kotlin and Java.
- [ksp](https://github.com/google/ksp): Kotlin Symbol Processing API.
- [Material-Components](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android): Material design components for building ripple animation, and CardView.
- [Landscapist](https://github.com/skydoves/landscapist): Image loading library for compose using Glide, Coil, and Fresco.

## Why MVVM?
MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) remains a popular architectural pattern for Android development for several reasons:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Separation of concerns is an important principle of software development. It allows you to focus on one aspect of a problem at a time, which makes it easier to reason about complex systems. MVVM helps you separate concerns by keeping your UI code separate from your business logic code.
  - Model (Data): Represents the data and business logic.
  - View (UI): Represents the UI components.
  - ViewModel: Acts as a mediator between the Model and the View. It holds and manages the UI-related data needed by the View and handles user interactions.
- **Maintainability & Testability**: The separation of concerns that MVVM provides makes your code simpler to maintain and test. You can replace one piece of code without affecting another.
- **Reusability**: ViewModel instances can be more easily reused across different UI components. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the same data or logic needs to be displayed or used in multiple places.
